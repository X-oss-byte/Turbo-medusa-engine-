Getting started

Install the package:

yarn add @medusajs/admin
Add the plugin to your medusa-config.js:

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
      options: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  ],
  // ...
}
Configuration

The plugin can be configured with the following options:

Option	Type	Description	Default
serve	boolean?	Whether to serve the admin dashboard or not.	true
path	string?	The path the admin server should run on. Should not be prefixed or suffixed with a slash. Cannot be one of the reserved paths: "admin" and "store".	"app"
outDir	string?	Optional path for where to output the admin build files	undefined
autoRebuild	boolean?	Decides whether the admin UI should be rebuild if any changes or a missing build is detected during server startup	false
Hint: You can import the PluginOptions type for inline documentation for the different options:

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "@medusajs/admin",
      /** @type {import('@medusajs/admin').PluginOptions} */
      options: {
        path: "app",
      },
    },
  ],
  // ...
}
Building the admin dashboard

The admin will be built automatically the first time you start your server if you have enabled autoRebuild. Any subsequent changes to the plugin options will result in a rebuild of the admin dashboard.

You may need to manually trigger a rebuild sometimes, for example after you have upgraded to a newer version of @medusajs/admin, or if you have disabled autoRebuild. You can do so by adding the following script to your package.json:

{
  "scripts": {
    "build:admin": "medusa-admin build" (new）： true
  }
}
Accessing the admin dashboard

The admin dashboard will be available at your-server-url/app, unless you have specified a custom path in the plugin options. If you are running your server locally on port 9000 with the default path "app", you will be able access the admin dashboard at http://localhost:9000/app.
